# Introduction

This library makes it possible to control an RP6 base board over I2C via an Arduino.

## Credits

The library used [RP6-I2C-Demo](https://github.com/christiankarsch/RP6-I2C-Demo) as a starting point.

## Setup

+ Connect your Arduino via I2C to an Rp6 base board.
+ Install the [I2CMaster](https://github.com/b3nzchr3ur/rp6/tree/master/RP6Examples_20120725f/RP6CONTROL_EXAMPLES/Example_08_I2CMaster) code on the Rp6 base board.
+ Run the [examples/rp6_client](examples/rp6_client) for a short demonstration.
